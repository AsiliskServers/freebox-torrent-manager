Freebox discovery
To discover a Freebox supporting this API you can either use mDNS, or make a HTTP request to mafreebox.freebox.fr to get API information.

Discovery using mDNS
This is the preferred method since it does not require to know the Freebox IP address.

The Freebox broadcasts the “_fbx-api._tcp” service

On iOS devices, you can use a NSNetServiceBrowser

On Android devices, you can use Network Service Discovery or JmDNS

On the TXT record you can obtain the following information:

Key	Description
api_version	The current API version on the Freebox
device_type	(DEPRECATED: use box_model)
api_base_url	The API root path on the HTTP server
uid	The device unique id
api_domain	The domain to use in place of hardcoded Freebox ip
https_available	Tells if https has been configured on the Freebox
https_port	Port to use for remote https access to the Freebox Api
box_model_name	Box model display name
box_model	Box model
Currently the existing box models are

box_model	Description
fbxgw-r1/full	Freebox Server (v6) revision 1
fbxgw-r2/full	Freebox Server (v6) revision 2
fbxgw-r1/mini	Freebox Mini revision 1
fbxgw-r2/mini	Freebox Mini revision 2
fbxgw-r1/one	Freebox One revision 1
fbxgw-r2/one	Freebox One revision 2
fbxgw7-r1/full	Freebox v7 revision 1
fbxgw8-r1/full	Freebox v8 revision 1
fbxgw9-r1/full	Freebox v9 revision 1
Discovery using HTTP
If you can, avoid this method because it requires to use a hardcoded address to retrieve API information.

If you make a HTTP get request on http://mafreebox.freebox.fr/api_version you can get the same API information as provided in mDNS.

Example request:

GET /api_version HTTP/1.1
Host: mafreebox.freebox.fr
Example response:

{
   "uid": "23b86ec8091013d668829fe12791fdab",
   "device_name": "Freebox Server",
   "box_model": "fbxgw7-r1/full",
   "box_model_name": "Freebox v7 (r1)",
   "api_version": "15.0",
   "api_base_url": "/api/",
   "api_domain": "example.fbxos.fr",
   "https_available": true,
   "https_port": 3615
}
Only the fields available to build the API request URL (see below) are available if you connect remotely.

Discovery using HTTPS
Discovery using HTTPS works the same as discovery on HTTP. You can do an HTTP GET request on https://mafreebox.freebox.fr/api_version . You need to validate the certificate as explained below in HTTPS access.

Discovery using HTTPS is preferred to HTTP discovery if you can’t use mDNS. You MUST implement the certificate validation in your app in order to use the API.

Building the API request URL
Once you’ve discovered a Freebox on the local network you can access the API at the following URL:

https://[api_domain]:[freebox_port]/[api_base_url]/v[major_api_version]/[api_url]
or for local access

https://mafreebox.freebox.fr/[api_base_url]/v[major_api_version]/[api_url]

Example:

https://example.fbxos.fr:3615/api/v15/login/
Remote connection port change discovery
When the https connection fails to a previously recorded https://[api_domain]:[https_port], you should attempt to discover if https_port has changed. This can happen either automatically (port is no longer valid), or manually if the user decided to change the port.

The https port is announced in a DNS “_https._tcp” SRV record. For example, for domain [example.fbxos.fr], the SRV record will be:

# _service._proto.name.      TTL class SRV priority weight port  target
_https._tcp.example.fbxos.fr 300 IN    SRV 13       37     12345 example.fbxos.fr
Here, only the “port” field of the SRV record is relevant, i.e 12345. The SRV field is only populated for the https port, and only for the [api_domain] field of the API information.

Port change discovery is important to maintain remote connectability.

API conventions
Most API uses the REST architecture, pay attention to the http methods used for each request.

For requests with a body, you must use “application/json” content-type unless otherwise stated.

The API response is always a JSON object using utf8 encoding.

APIResponse
success boolean Read-only
indicates if the request was successful

result object Read-only
the result of the request.

(It may be omitted if the request does not expect any result)

error_code string Read-only
In case of request error, this error_code provides information about the error.

The possible error_code values are documented for each API.

msg string Read-only
In cas of error, provides a French error message relative to the error

Successful response example

{
   success: true,
   result: {
      logged_in: false,
      challenge: "WpsbHdkBpRpHLMGQHZ1ri1uUqa4ce6Dw"
   }
}
Error response example

{
   msg: "Requête invalide",
   success: false,
   error_code: "invalid_request"
}
The HTTP response code can also be used to error reason, for instance if you attempt to access to an API with invalid credential you will get a 403 error, or if you attempt to call an API with an invalid path you will get a 404 error.

HTTPS Access
Each Freebox is now automatically assigned a random domain name (api_domain), and an associated TLS certificate to enable secure access to API.

This is enabled by default and all applications MUST now use HTTPS to access the api. Unsecure access will be removed at some point.

Certificates used for HTTPS access are emitted by either ‘Freebox ECC Root CA’ in case of ECDSA access, or ‘Freebox Root CA’ in case of RSA.

You must validate the certificate chain, by using the following Root CA certificates:

-----END CERTIFICATE-----
Authentication
Unless otherwise stated API access must be authenticated using the procedure described in the following document

Login
Each application identified with an app_name must gain access to Freebox API before being able to use the api. This procedure can only be initiated from the local network, and the user must have access to the Freebox front panel to grant access to the app. Note that since you must be on the local network, you must do your requests on https://mafreebox.freebox.fr for the initial app authorization, since adding a new app is forbidden from the outside network, and then use the generated [api_domain]:[freebox_port] for subsequent accesses.

Once the user authorize the app, the app will be provided with a unique app_token associated with a set of default permissions.

This app_token must be store securely by the app, and will not be exchanged in clear text for the following requests.

Note that the user can revoke the app_token, or edit its permissions afterwards. For instance if the user resets the admin password, app permissions will be reset.

Then the app will need to open a session to get an auth_token. The app will then be authenticated by adding this session_token in HTTP headers of the following requests. The validity of the auth_token is limited in time and the app will have to renew this auth_token once in a while.

Obtaining an app_token
TokenRequest object
TokenRequest objects have the following attributes

TokenRequest
app_id string
A unique app_id string

app_name string
A descriptive application name (will be displayed on lcd)

app_version string
app version

device_name string
The name of the device on which the app will be used

Request authorization
This is the first step, the app will ask for an app_token using the following call. A message will be displayed on the Freebox LCD asking the user to grant/deny access to the requesting app.

Once the app has obtained a valid app_token, it will not have to do this procedure again unless the user revokes the app_token.

POST /api/v8/login/authorize/
Example request:

POST /api/v8/login/authorize/ HTTP/1.1
Host: mafreebox.freebox.fr

{
   "app_id": "fr.freebox.testapp",
   "app_name": "Test App",
   "app_version": "0.0.7",
   "device_name": "Pc de Xavier"
}
Example response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
   "success": true,
   "result": {
      "app_token": "dyNYgfK0Ya6FWGqq83sBHa7TwzWo+pg4fDFUJHShcjVYzTfaRrZzm93p7OTAfH/0",
      "track_id": 42
   }
}
Track authorization progress
Once the authorization request has been made, the app should monitor the token status by using the following API and using the track_id returned by the previous call.

The status can have one of the following values:

Status	Description
unknown	the app_token is invalid or has been revoked
pending	the user has not confirmed the authorization request yet
timeout	the user did not confirmed the authorization within the given time
granted	the app_token is valid and can be used to open a session
denied	the user denied the authorization request
The app should monitor the status until it is different from pending. You MUST implement this monitoring, otherwise your authorization will be invalid, even if the user grants you access.

GET /api/v8/login/authorize/{track_id}
Example request:

GET /api/v8/login/authorize/42 HTTP/1.1
Host: mafreebox.freebox.fr
Example response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
    "success": true,
    "result": {
        "status": "pending",
        "challenge": "Bj6xMqoe+DCHD44KqBljJ579seOXNWr2"
    }
}
Example response once the user has validated the request:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
    "success": true,
    "result": {
        "status": "granted",
        "challenge": "Bj6xMqoe+DCHD44KqBljJ579seOXNWr2"
    }
}
Obtaining a session_token
To protect the app_token secret, it will never be used directly to authenticate the application, instead the API will provide a challenge the app will combine to its app_token to open a session and get a session_token

The app will then have to include the session_token in the HTTP headers of the following requests

SessionStart object
SessionStart objects have the following attributes:

SessionStart
app_id string
Same app_id used in TokenRequest to get the app_token

app_version string
app version

password string
The password computed using the challenge and the app_token

To compute the password you have to compute the hmac-sha1 of the challenge and the app_token

password = hmac-sha1(app_token, challenge)

Getting the challenge value
The challenge returned by the API will change frequently and have a limited time validity.

There are several ways of getting the current challenge value, it will always be included in response requesting the app authentication. It is also included in the authorization tracking API response.

You can also explicitly request a challenge with the following API

GET /api/v8/login/
Example request:

GET /api/v8/login/ HTTP/1.1
Host: mafreebox.freebox.fr
Example response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
    "success": true,
    "result": {
        "logged_in": false,
        "challenge": "VzhbtpR4r8CLaJle2QgJBEkyd8JPb0zL"
    }
}
Opening a session
Once you have the challenge you just need use the following API to get a session_token

NOTE: in case of session opening failure, ensure that the box you’re connected is the one you expect by checking the uid returned in the answer.

In the response you get your app permissions. App permissions are:

App permission	Description
settings	Allow modifying the Freebox settings (reading settings is always allowed)
contacts	Access to contact list
calls	Access to call logs
explorer	Access to filesystem
downloader	Access to downloader
parental	Access to parental control (obsolete)
pvr	Access personal video recorder
profile	Access to user profile management
NOTE: A permission not listed in app permissions is equivalent to having this permission set to false.

POST /api/v8/login/session/
Example request:

POST /api/v8/login/session/ HTTP/1.1
Host: mafreebox.freebox.fr

{
   "app_id": "fr.freebox.testapp",
   "password": "d4da8517c2c25b1b145f2e5ba91bd0589fc0053d"
}
Example response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
   "success": true,
   "result" : {
         "session_token" : "35JYdQSvkcBYK84IFMU7H86clfhS75OzwlQrKlQN1gBch\/Dd62RGzDpgC7YB9jB2",
         "challenge":"jdGL6CtuJ3Dm7p9nkcIQ8pjB+eLwr4Ya",
         "permissions": {
               "downloader": true,
         }
    }
}
Example response with invalid password:

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
    "msg": "Erreur d'authentification de l'application",
    "success": false,
    "uid": "23b86ec8091013d668829fe12791fdab",
    "error_code": "invalid_token",
    "result": {
         "challenge": "DLjXFEf1kaDwAEn6xRUnEVPU++gnjiSn"
    }
}
Closing the current session
to close the current session you can use the following call

POST /api/v8/login/logout/
Example request:

POST /api/v8/login/logout/ HTTP/1.1
Host: mafreebox.freebox.fr
Example response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
   "success": true,
}
Make an authenticated call to the API
Once you have a valid session_token you should use it by add the the HTTP header X-Fbx-App-Auth

Example request:

GET /api/v8/login/session/ HTTP/1.1
Host: mafreebox.freebox.fr
X-Fbx-App-Auth: 35JYdQSvkcBYK84IFMU7H86clfhS75OzwlQrKlQN1gBch\/Dd62RGzDpgC7YB9jB2
Example response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
   "success": true,
   "result" : {
         [
            ...
         ]
    }
}
Authentication errors
When attempting to access the API, you may encounter the following authentication errors:

NOTE that in this case the HTTP 403 return code will be used as well

Error	Description
auth_required	Invalid session token, or not session token sent
invalid_token	The app token you are trying to use is invalid or has been revoked
pending_token	The app token you are trying to use has not been validated by user yet
insufficient_rights	Your app permissions does not allow accessing this API
denied_from_external_ip	You are trying to get an app_token from a remote IP
invalid_request	Your request is invalid
ratelimited	Too many auth error have been made from your IP
new_apps_denied	New application token request has been disabled
apps_denied	API access from apps has been disabled
internal_error	Internal error
WebSocket API
WebSocket allow bidirectional communication between your api client and the Freebox. This allow more interactivity without the need of frequently polling data from the Freebox.

For WebSocket access, you must use the same Authentication mechanism as for regular http api request. This means that you must include a proper X-Fbx-App-Auth header when you open the WebSocket connection.

Once the connection is established, most of messages sent via the WebSocket are text based (using utf-8 as per WebSocket specifications) and encoded as JSON objects.

The WebSocket frames maximum accepted size is 1 MB

WebSocket API conventions
As for HTTP api, the client can make requests to the Freebox (the available requests are specified per api).

The requests use the following format:

WebSocketRequest
request_id int Optionnal
if you specify a request_id in your request, it will be added in the corresponding reply, so that you can correlate responses to the request

action string
the request ‘action’

(available actions are described in each api)

Other fields, related to a specific action, will be used as ‘action’ parameters

Responses to such requests will have the following format:

WebSocketResponse
request_id int
if you set a request_id in your WebSocketRequest, the same request_id will be returned in the associated response

action string
the action specified in the associated WebSocketRequest

success boolean Read-only
indicates if the request was successful

result object Read-only
the result of the request.

(It may be omitted if the request does not expect any result)

error_code string Read-only
In case of request error, this error_code provides information about the error.

The possible error_code values are documented for each API.

msg string Read-only
In cas of error, provides a French error message relative to the error

When the Freebox wants to send a notification on WebSocket it will have the following format:

WebSocketNotification
action enum Read-only
The action will have the value ‘notification’

success boolean Read-only
will be True

source string Read-only
The name of the source of the notification

event string Read-only
The name of event that generated the notification

result object Read-only
the content of the notification (may be omitted if no data has to be transferred along with the notification)

WebSocket event API
This API is used to send events to an application, removing the need to poll when waiting for a long operation to complete. It follows the conventions of the WebSocket API.

This is a text websocket that sends json, one per line.

GET /api/v8/ws/event
The application sends RegisterACtion to subscribe to an event channel. It will subsequently receive events on this websocket.

Register Action
RegisterAction
action enum
Value should be “register”

events[] array of enum
List of events to subscribe for. Possible values:

event name	event result object type	Description
vm_state_changed	VmStateChange	VM status has changed
vm_disk_task_done	VmDiskTask	VM disk task done
lan_host_l3addr_reachable	LanHost	LAN machine had an L3 address (IPv4 or IPv6) become reachable. Usually when a machine appears on the network, or changes IP.
lan_host_l3addr_unreachable	LanHost	LAN machine had an L3 address (IPv4 or IPv6) become unreachable. Usually when a machine disappears from the network (after a timeout), or changes IP.
Response is usually {"success": true, "action": "register"}

Events will be sent as WebSocketNotification ; the event name will be split in source (prefix) and event (suffix). For example, vm_disk_task_done will have source “vm”, and event “disk_task_done”:

{
   "action" : "notification",
   "success" : true,
   "source" : "vm"
   "event" : "disk_task_done",
   "result" : {
      "done" : true,
      "error" : false,
      "id" : 1
   }
}

Incoming port configuration
Some services hosted on the Freebox Server need to listen to public ip address port. Incoming port api allow to enable/disable incoming port binding, and select the bind port to prevent conflit with your own nat port forwarding rules.

NOTE: you can’t add or remove incoming ports, this ports are managed by Freebox services.

NOTE: in case of conflict with a nat port forwarding rule, this rule will have a higher priority and override the port forwarding rule.

duration int Write-only
temporary disable duration

keep enum Write-only
specify a wifi band to keep active

keep	Description
2d4g	keep only 2,4Ghz band active
5g	keep only 5GHz bands active
6g	keep only 6GHz band active
remaining int Read-only
remaining seconds the wifi is temporarily disabled. Set to 0 to stop the temporary wifi disabling period.

Multi Link Operation (MLO)
For a given BSS you can configure with which bands it will try to participate in an MLD. Whatever the configuration is, the operational state may be different if the BSS on the partner AP is unavailable (disabled or no EHT) or does not have the right parameters (not using shared params or wrong security)

Available partner
To get the available AP partner of a BSS use the mlo/allowed_comb api to return a list of possible combinations:

GET /api/v14/wifi/bss/{id}/mlo/allowed_comb
Get the allowed phy combination for a BSS

Example request:

GET /api/v14/wifi/bss/02:00:00:00:00:00/mlo/allowed_comb HTTP/1.1
Host: mafreebox.freebox.fr
Example response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
“success”: true, “result”: [

[ 0, 1 ], [ 0 ]

]

}

MLO configuration object
WifiMLOConfiguration
partners [int]
List of phys participating in the MLD for the BSS An empty array means MLO is disabled An array with only the BSS’s AP index in it means SLO (single link mode) The allowed combinations are retrieved by the mlo/allowed_comb api.

Getting the MLO config
To get the currently configured partners of a BSS mlo/config. It will return the current WifiMLOConfiguration for this BSS

GET /api/v14/wifi/bss/{id}/mlo/config
Get the current WifiMLOConfiguration for the BSS

Example request:

GET /api/v14/wifi/bss/02:00:00:00:00:00/mlo/config HTTP/1.1

{
   "success": true,
   "result": {
      partners: [ 0, 1 ]
   }
}
Changing the MLO config
To update the MLO confuguration put a new WifiMLOConfiguration at mlo/config. Please note that only combinations from mlo/allowed_comb can be used for the ‘partners’ field

PUT /api/v9/wifi/config/
Update the WifiGlobalConfig

Example request:

Adding a new Download task
Adding by URL
Supported URL scheme are http://, ftp://, magnet:

You can start a recursive download by setting the recursive parameter. The downloader will then extract links from each donwloaded html page and continue downloading files on the same domain and on the same root path. This can be used to download all the files on a directory index.

You can add multiple downloads at once by passing a list of URL (separated by a new line delimiter) in download_url_list instead of using download_url.

/!NOTE: for this API the request arguments must be encoded using “application/x-www-form-urlencoded” (or “multipart/form-data” for file upload) instead of “application/json”

POST /api/v8/downloads/add
Parameters
download_url (string) – The URL
download_url_list (string) – A list of URL separated by a new line delimiter (use download_url or download_url_list)
download_dir (string) – The download destination directory (optional: will use the configuration download_dir by default)
filename (string) – Override the name of the destination file. Only valid with one, non-recursive download_url.
hash (string) – Verify the hash of the downloaded file. The format is sha256:xxxxxx or sha512:xxxxxx; or the URL of a SHA256SUMS, SHA512SUMS, -CHECKSUM or .sha256 file. Only valid with one, non-recursive download_url.
recursive (bool) – If true the download will be recursive
username (string) – Auth username (optional)
password (string) – Auth password (optional)
archive_password (string) – The password required to extract downloaded content (only relevant for nzb)
cookies (string) – The http cookies (to be able to pass session cookies along with url). This is the content of the HTTP Cookie header, for example: cookie1=value1; cookie2=value2
NOTE: instead of passing password and username you can include them in the URL.

File System Api
File System
With the file system API you can access files on Freebox internal disk and disks connected to the Freebox.

Path encoding
NOTE:

For maximum compatibility issues path are encoded in base64, you should use the path as it is returned by the ls API call.

For instance this will solve problems with unicode equivalence .

Although “Spécial” (0x53 0x70 0xc3 0xa9 0x63 0x69 0x61 0x6c) and “Spécial” (0x53 0x70 0x65 0xcc 0x81 0x63 0x69 0x61 0x6c) are utf8 equivalent, it represents two different paths.

Some software/libraries will replace the original string with its normalized form, causing issues. The use of base64 encoded path will ensure the original path will be preserved.

Operations
Each time you want to perform a modification on the file system you will have to create a new FsTask that you will be able to monitor.

NOTE: The requested operation may be en-queued to avoid performance drop because of excessive disk io

Conflict resolution
For certain file operations where a file name conflict can happen, you must specify a conflict resolution mode.

Valid resolution modes are:

Conflict mode	Description
overwrite	Overwrite the destination file
both	Keep both files (rename the file adding a suffix)
recent	Only overwrite if newer than destination file
skip	Keep the destination file
Move files
POST /api/v15/fs/mv/
Parameters
files (string[]) – The list of files to move
dst (string) – The destination
mode (enum) – The conflict resolution mode
Example request for moving files:

File Upload
This API allows you to upload files to the Freebox Server.

NOTE: for large transfer files, you should prefer FTP over HTTP transfer

WARNING the previous http upload method is now deprecated since api v4, you must now use the new WebSocket upload Api. If you can’t support WebSocket, you must use ftp for file transfer

File Upload Errors
When attempting to access the file upload API, you may encounter the following errors:

error_code	Description
invalid_request	Invalid request
path_not_found	File or folder not found
access_denied	Write permission denied in the destination folder
destination_conflict	A file with same name already exists
invalid_id	Invalid file upload id
cancelled	Someone on a side channel as cancelled the upload
noent	No upload with this id
File Upload object
File uploads have the following attributes:

FileUpload
id int Read-only
upload id

size int Read-only
Upload file size in bytes

uploaded int Read-only
Uploaded bytes

status enum Read-only
upload status can have the following values

status	Description
authorized	Upload authorization is valid, upload has not started yet
in_progress	Upload in progress
done	Upload done
failed	Upload failed
conflict	Destination file conflict
timeout	Upload authorization is no longer valid
cancelled	Upload cancelled by user
start_date timestamp Read-only
upload start date

last_update timestamp Read-only
last update of file upload object

upload_name string Read-only
name of the file uploaded

dirname string Read-only
upload destination directory

WebSocket File Upload API
The file upload WebSocket path is /api/v8/ws/upload

With this new API, the need for creating a ‘file upload authorization’ has now been removed.

To be able to upload a file to the Freebox, you must open a WebSocket connection to the upload api, then for each file you want to upload you must :

send a FileUploadStartAction with the action ‘upload_start’

wait for the associated WebSocketResponse that indicates success, then start transferring the file content by chunks, each chunk being a binary WebSocket frame.

For each chunk you send, you’ll get a WsUploadProgress response indicating that the associated chunk has been received and processed. Note that you should not wait for this response before sending the next data chunk in order to get good bandwidth performance.

once all chunks have been transferred, you should send a FileUploadFinalizeAction with the action ‘upload_finalize’ and wait for the associated WebSocketResponse indicating success

Note that if you have multiple files to send, you should reuse the same WebSocket connection, and repeat the upload steps again.

If for any reason the WebSocket is closed during upload, the partially sent file will be left as-is on the Freebox to allow resuming upload at a later point.

If you want to cancel an ongoing upload ou can send a FileUploadCancelAction. The partially uploaded file will then be deleted

File Upload Start Action
FileUploadStartAction
request_id int
optional request_id

action string
must be ‘upload_start’

size int
optional file size

dirname string
the destination directory (encoded value)

filename string
the destination filename

force enum
select the way conflicts are handled

Force mode	Description
missing	The response to the FileUploadStartAction will be an error with ‘destination_conflict’ if the destination file already exists. The response will also contain a file_size attribute containing the existing file length (useful for resuming upload)
overwrite	If the target file already exists it will be overridden
resume	The upload will resume, all sent chunks will then be appended to the existing file.
File Upload Finalize action
FileUploadFinalizeAction
request_id int
optional request_id

action string
must be ‘upload_finalize’

File Upload Cancel action
FileUploadCancelAction
request_id int
optional request_id

action string
must be ‘upload_cancel’

File Upload Chunk
File upload chunk are just Binary WebSocket frames containing raw file content.

File Upload Chunk Response
For each received chunk, the Freebox will send a chunk response containing upload progress information the request_id used in response will be the one from the FileUploadStartAction, and ‘action’ value will be ‘upload_data’

FileUploadChunkResponse
total_len int
target file current length

complete bool
will be true in a reply to FileUploadFinalizeAction or FileUploadCancelAction

cancelled bool
will be true in a reply FileUploadCancelAction

text	This displays the endpoint value as text. Read access is always allowed when “text” is used. When write access is allowed, the text may be editable on user request. When the “unit” entry is present and not null, it specifies the physical unit associated to the endpoint value.
icon	This displays the icon fetched from “icon_url” with % being replaced by the string representation of the endpoint value. For string value type, the % is replaced by the endpoint value. For int and float value types, this requires an “icon_ranges” array of threshold values. The % is replaced by the index in the “range” array which is just below the endpoint value. For boolean value type, the % is replaced by “on” or “off”. When the “value” is null, the % is replaced by the empty string. Read access is always allowed when “icon” is used. Write access is not used.
button	This displays a push button. Write access is always allowed when “button” is used. A null value must be send to the endpoint when pushed.
slider	This displays a slider with the cursor located according to the endpoint value in the range specified by “range”. Read access is always allowed when “slider” is used. When write access is allowed, the cursor may be moved by the user. When write access is not allowed it may be displayed as a progress bar.
toggle	This displays an on/off switch. Read access is always allowed when “switch” is used. When write access is allowed, switch may be toggled by the user. A boolean value must be send to the endpoint when toggled.
color	This displays a color value. The value type is an int representing the RGB color. Read access is always allowed when “color” is used.
warning	This display the icon fetched from “icon_url” when the value condition is true. For boolean value type, the value is the condition. For int and float value types, this requires a “range” of size 2. If the value is within the range, the condition is true.

RRD
RRD [UNSTABLE]
With the rrd API you can retrieve stats collected on the Freebox. Right now the stats available are: network stats, switch stats, dsl stats, and temperature stats.

RRD Fetch Object
This is the object used to get stats

RRDFetch
db enum
Name of the rrd database to read. It can take one of the following values

Db	Description
net	network stats
temp	temperature stats
dsl	xDSL stats
switch	switch stats
date_start int Optionnal
The requested start timestamp of the stats to get

NOTE: this can be adjusted to fit the best available resolution

date_end int Optionnal
The requested end timestamp of the stats to get

NOTE: this can be adjusted to fit the best available resolution

precision int Optionnal
By default all values are cast to int, if you need floating point precision you can provide a precision factor that will be applied to all values before being returned.

For instance if you want 2 digit precision you should use a precision of 100, and divide the obtained results by 100.

fields[] array of string Optionnal
If you are only interested in getting some fields you can provide the list of fields you want to get.

For the net database the fields are:

Field	Description
bw_up	upload available bandwidth (in byte/s)
bw_down	download available bandwidth (in byte/s)
rate_up	upload rate (in byte/s)

Get FS advices
GET /api/v8/storage/disk/{disk_id}/fsadvice?partition_id={partition_id}&dedicated_disk={bool}
Check disk FS and get formatting advices.

To be able to get FS advice for a disk you need to provide the disk_id. Specify dedicated_disk for a disk that will only be used with the Freebox server (no need to specify it for a SATA internal disk). If the disk is empty do not specify partition_id in order to get advice for creating a new one. If the disk contains a partition specify the partition_id that needs to be checked.

Create a RAID array
POST /api/v8/storage/raid/
Send a RaidArray with the following members:
level
name
members
Each member should have the following property:
id
Delete a RAID array
DELETE /api/v8/storage/raid/{id}
Start or stop a RAID array
Send a RaidArray with properties “id” and “state”.

This is used to start and stop an array by changing the state to “stopped” or “running”. These are the only two supported operations. Any change to other fields is ignored.

PUT /api/v8/storage/raid/{id}
Force start a RAID array
In case an array is incomplete, but has enough data to start in degraded mode, it won’t start automatically at boot, and the force start can be used. Can only be done if array state is “error”.

POST /api/v8/storage/raid/{id}/forcestart
Remove faulty members from RAID array
In case an array has faulty members, it might be desirable to delete them to add others members instead. Can only be done if array is not running.

DELETE /api/v8/storage/raid/{id}/members/faulty
Add members to an existing array that has missing members
In case an array is incomplete (has missing members), either because they were removed physically, or after becoming faulty, it’s possible to add new members to let the reconstruction happen. Can only be done if array is not running.

PUT /api/v8/storage/raid/{id}/members
Send a json object containing a “members” property, which is array of RaidMember objects. Only the “id” property of each member is required.

Re-add out-of-sync members that appear as spares
In case an array has been force-started without a member, and then said member is physically plugged, it won’t be added automatically and will appear with the “spare” role, this operation must be used. Can only be done if the array has a member with the “spare” role, and is not running.

POST /api/v8/storage/raid/{id}/members/addspares
